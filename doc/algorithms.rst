FastSpecFit Algorithms
======================

**Under construction.**

* Document the SSPs.
* Initial line-sigma estimation.
* Finding significant lines; masking.  
* Fast NNLS.
* Reddening.
* Velocity dispersion (with criteria).
* Smooth continuum correction.  
* Line-fitting (broad, narrow).
* Continuum, EWs, upper limits, etc.
* K-corrections.
* If the inverse variance on a given absolutely magnitude is zero it means that
  the absolute magnitude was derived from *synthesized* photometry based on the
  best-fitting model (i.e., use with care).
* If CONTINUUM_AV_IVAR is zero it means that fitted for the (intrinsic) dust
  extinction failed.

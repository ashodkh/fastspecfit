Welcome to the Documentation for FastSpecFit
============================================

Overview
--------

``FastSpecFit`` is a stellar continuum and emission-line modeling code for `DESI
<https://desi.lbl.gov>`_ which is optimized for speed and simplicity; it can be
called independently to fit the broadband photometry (``fastphot``) or the
three-camera optical spectrophotometry from DESI (``fastspec``), although in
either case DESI redshifts are required.

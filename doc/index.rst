Welcome to the Documentation for FastSpecFit
============================================

Overview
--------

FastSpecFit is a stellar continuum and emission-line modeling code for `DESI
<https://desi.lbl.gov>`_ optimized for speed and simplicity.

FastSpecFit can be called independently to fit the broadband photometry
(*fastphot*) or the three-camera optical spectroscopy from DESI (*fastspec*),
although in both cases DESI redshifts are a required input.
